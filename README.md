# Capital Asset Pricing Model Using Python

CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) is a model that described the relationship between the expected return and risk securities, or the general perils of investing, and expected return for assets, particularly stocks.

CAPM indicates that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk-free returm plus a risk premium.

    ERi=Rf+Î²i(ERmâˆ’Rf)

where:

ERi=expected return of investment

Rf=risk-free rate

Î²i=beta of the investment or systematic risk

(ERmâˆ’Rf)=market risk premium
